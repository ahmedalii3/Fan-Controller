# Fan-Controller
This project involves designing a temperature-controlled fan system using an ATmega32 microcontroller and an LM35 temperature sensor. The microcontroller monitors the temperature, displays it on an LCD, and adjusts the fan speed using PWM signals based on predefined temperature thresholds.
